# ♻️ Waste Classification using CNN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**Waste Classification using CNN** is a deep learning project built on **Google Colab** that classifies waste into different categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The goal is to promote **efficient waste segregation**, which is crucial for **sustainable development** and **smart waste management systems**.  

This project demonstrates how AI can help build a cleaner and greener environment by automating the waste classification process.

## 🚀 How to Run in Google Colab  

1. Open the Colab Notebook:  
   - Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Drive or open it directly in Colab.  

2. Install required libraries (if not already available in Colab):  
   ```python
   !pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
