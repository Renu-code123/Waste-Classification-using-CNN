# ♻️ Waste Classification using CNN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**Waste Classification using CNN** is a deep learning project built on **Google Colab** that classifies waste into different categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The goal is to promote **efficient waste segregation**, which is crucial for **sustainable development** and **smart waste management systems**.  

This project demonstrates how AI can help build a cleaner and greener environment by automating the waste classification process.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Implemented and trained on **Google Colab**  
- ✅ Image preprocessing and augmentation for better performance  
- ✅ CNN-based waste image classification  
- ✅ Supports multiple categories (Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous, etc.)  
- ✅ Easy to use and scalable for real-time applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run in Google Colab  

1. Open the Colab Notebook:  
   - Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Drive or open it directly in Colab.  

2. Install required libraries (if not already available in Colab):  
   ```python
   !pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python

📊 Dataset

We used a Waste Classification Dataset containing labeled images of different types of waste.
Categories include:

-🥗 Organic

-🧴 Recyclable (Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, etc.)

📈 Results

-Achieved high accuracy on validation data
-Plotted training vs validation curves

🌍 Future Scope

-Deploy as a Web/Mobile Application
-Integrate with IoT Smart Bins
-Improve the dataset with more real-world waste images
